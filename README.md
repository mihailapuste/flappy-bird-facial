## Game Controls

- **Smile**: Makes the bird fly upward

- **Reset Game Button**: Resets the game after losing

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the game graphics
- **face-api.js**: For real-time facial expression detection
- **Socket.io**: For real-time communication between components
- **Express.js**: For the web server
- **JavaScript ES6+**: For game logic and interaction

## How It Works

The game uses face-api.js to analyze your facial expressions in real-time. When you smile, the system detects the "happy" expression and sends a signal to make the bird fly upward. The game physics handle gravity, collision detection, and scoring.

When you lose the game, it captures a screenshot of your face at that moment, giving you a fun memento of your reaction to losing!

## Customization

You can adjust several aspects of the game:

- **Pipe Gap Size**: Currently set to 200px for easier gameplay
- **Game Speed**: Pipes move at a moderate pace for better playability
- **Bird Physics**: Gravity and jump strength are tuned for smooth control
- **Smile Sensitivity**: Adjustable via the slider in the UI

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with webcam access (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Webcam or built-in camera
